                    <h2>Earth</h2>
                    <p>The day has come. Bob was sitting on his hard blue wooden chair staring at the night
                        sky waiting for the perfect oppurtunity. That opportunity was anybodys guess but his.
                        His moment, his time to shine, quite literally of course. The time he could stare up 
                        at the sky and see the magnificent moon in all of it's glowing white glory. We all
                        know the moon doesn't actually glow but it is a reflection of the suns light bouncing
                        off of the Moon and into our eyes. But that's not where the story ends. For Bob,
                        looking at the moon fills him with a sense of awe, even he can't explain. "What is it like?
                        Being such a massive immovable object sitting in the night sky?" he would always wonder.
                        This thing of beaty that sits, waiting to be noticed, surely it has a purpose for being there.
                        But who knows, not Bob that's for sure.
