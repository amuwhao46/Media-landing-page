                    <p>The day has come. Bob was sitting on his hard blue wooden chair staring at the night
                        sky waiting for the perfect oppurtunity. That opportunity was anybodys guess but his.
                        His moment, his time to shine, quite literally of course. The time he could stare up 
                        at the sky and see the magnificent moon in all of it's glowing white glory. We all
                        know the moon doesn't actually glow but it is a reflection of the suns light bouncing
                        off of the Moon and into our eyes. But that's not where the story ends. For Bob,
                        looking at the moon fills him with a sense of awe, even he can't explain. "What is it like?
                        Being such a massive immovable object sitting in the night sky?" he would always wonder.
                        This thing of beaty that sits, waiting to be noticed, surely it has a purpose for being there.
                        But who knows, not Bob that's for sure.

                    <p>Stop what you're doing and stare. What do you see? Seeing happens but why,
                        what is there to always be seen? When the only thing you can do is stare at 
                        at one thing for all of (what seems like) eternety, what could possibly be there
                        to see? Every day of every month of every year goes the same cycle. Maybe if you're 
                        lucky you feel a warmth as the phoenix of the solar system warms you up. What could
                        possibly be seen. Is there someone else that could be observing such boring happenings?
                        How would I ever hope to know? every day is the same, chase after something, keep going 
                        but does it end? One day I just woke up, no memory of what I was before and not enough
                        forsight to predict what I'll be afterward. The only thing I can imagine is what is
                        happening here.

                        looking out, or within? Such a mystery that one can experience everything and nothing. An 
                        insignificant spec of dust existing in the vast void. It all exists for one... the observer.
                        Without it there would be nothing, everything exists because of it, and it exists because of
