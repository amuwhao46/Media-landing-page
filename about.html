                <p> I am an up and coming computer software engineer who loves partaking in various activities.
                    Recently I started a job at a very well known tech company (retail side). So far I love it
                    and I'm using a lot of the skills I've learned to improve my personal life. I've always been a 
                    fan of technology and what it has to offer but recently I've also taken a liking into
                    automobiles. Another thing I have an interest in is the financial market. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to investing I see that as a priority because the future is unknown and scary.
                    I want to make sure I am somewhat prepared for a lot of things that could potentially happen.
                    Because of this I have tried to diversify my income through stocks, ETF's, and cryptocurrency.
                    I don't really have a strong basis for cryptocurrency but I have some money it etherium just for fun.
                    The money I have in my Roth IRA is more important to me because it forces me to save and have a goal
                    that could help me as I progress through life. <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a> 
                    is a great place to get started investing because of its simplicity. You could also use
