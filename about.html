            <p> Currently I am a junior in college, majoring in Computer science. I work in technology company 
                I'm afraid to name because of association but I work in one of their retail stores in my area.
                I dream of becoming a software engineer, specifically fullstack web developer or even networking
                after I gradutate college. I decided to do this little project moslty because it's my final for my
                Web development class. My other interests are psychology and philosophy in tandem with technology.
                All three of these categories fascinate me bacause of the curios nature I have.
            </p>

                Ever since I was young I always had a fascination with outerspace. What is out there? how far 
                can we get? what are black holes really? My curiosity of the cosmos always drove me to devise
                ways to understand what is beyond the scope of our planet. Recently I've taken interest a little
                closer to home, specifically the mind. To me the brain and mind is just as unknown as outerspace.
                I believe whatever secrets lie behind those hidden places will give us the same answer... If we ever
                find them. I've always found it crazy how we're able to build such amazing structures, travel
                into the deepest parts of our solar system, even creat insulin but we can't explain the thing that 
                explains everything (ourselves). 
            </p>
            <p>
                As I go through life and learn and grow, there is one thing I want to see humanity achieve. That one 
                thing I want to see is the beginning of an answer to the hard problem of consciousness. To be honest
                if we ever do start to have a working answer to that problem, I don't think we'll be ready for it.
                Nevertheless, if we are able to have the beginnings of an answer we could use that to finally build
                artificial intelligence and understant what awereness is. Maybe one day I will be a part of that discoverey
                but for now I'm living day by day in awe that I can even experience any of this. Yet alone build a 
                functional website.
